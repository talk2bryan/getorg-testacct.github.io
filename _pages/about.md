I am from Nigeria, and have moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to complete my B.Sc. and now M.Sc. program both in Computer Science at the University of Manitoba. I also am studying under the supervision of [Dr. Carson K. Leung](http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~kleung/ "Dr. Carson K. Leung's Homepage") of the [Databeses and Data Mining Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/site/dblabuofm/) in the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.umanitoba.ca/ "Computer Science Homepage").

My interests are in the following fields:
  * Data Science (including Data Mining, Data Visualization, etc),
  * Cloud Computing,
  * DevOps,
  * Software Development,
  * Process Optimization

Presently, I am in my first year of grad school and am actively taking classes as well as teaching in the capacity of a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Science.
